sequent upon the gift of him, so that z'n him we live

and move and have our being. So complete is God's

gift to man that, unless he fall into sin, he has the

use of all things. We have here the sketch of what
Wycliffe afterwards expanded in the early part of his

first book de civili Dominio. The correlative of CH. 111.
giving, receiving, is with regard to God but another

him for his labour; but from God he can only

touched ; a fuller treatment will be found in the De civ. Dom. i. 10, 14,
&c. But the doctrine is of course a familiar one in theological
exposition: see for instance William os Auvergne, de Sacram. Ordinis,
