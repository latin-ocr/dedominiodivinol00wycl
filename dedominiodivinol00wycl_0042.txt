xxxviii PREFACE.

more properly described as his use and his possession
than as his lordship. God had possession of the
whole world from the beginning, and use of it so far
as there was any room for its exercise. The formal
description of God’s lordship is ‘the full right of
possessing the world and using it fully and freely
with all things therein contained, by means of pos-

and all else in it is as the specific difference whereby
God’s lordship is distinguished from all lordship of
his creatures? His lordship cannot be alienated by
any grant of his; it remains entire and universal.
When he entrusted government to the angels, this was
a commission of office, not properly of lordship. The
subject of God's possession and right of use is then
briefly resumed3 the former, the fruit of lordship,
consisting in the safe-keeping and maintenance of the
world, the latter being part of the definition of lordship.

Use, however, is a general term which covers a
variety of particular acts, and it is necessary to en-
quire in detail which of these acts are applicable to
God's lordship. Can he annihilate (this is denied),
consume, change, multiply or increase, give, lend?
can he protect and resume his gifts, sell, buy, and
receive? (all these acts are affirmed). The main
stress of the argument lies in the subject of giving.
If God’s lordship cannot be alienated‚ in what sense
can he be said to give anything? FitzRalph takes
the example of a number os men holding land in
common who admit a new member to the enjoyment
of their rights. In such a case they transfer or
alienate no part of their lordship, nor do they even
diminish it in extent. The paradox of the latter
