xl PREFACE.

CH.1x·x1V.ship. It is then shown how Adam received his lord-
ship for himself and his descendants, and how Christ
received it as man. Adam by sinning lost all his

CH. xv· original lordship, but when he repented and received

XIX‘ grace he received it also again, though without the

CH· ΧΧ- full power of exercising it. Original lordship is dis-

XXH' tinguished from the lordship acquired by virtue of
positive laws by the fact that it cannot be refused
when granted, nor abdicated except through sin.

CH. xxm. It cannot be increased or diminished in itself, only

cmxxxv. limited in act. When one man is preeminent over
others, he has not on that account any larger original

lordship, because this lordship depends upon nature,
not upon extrinsic conditions. His preeminence may
diminish the use of lordship among his subjects, but
CH. xxv. not their lordship itself. Positive laws became neces-
sary in consequence of sin3 but still, even had man never
sinned, some laws must have come into existence for
CH.xxv1. the guidance of human life. Nevertheless ruIe con-

the ruler would not thereby be enabled to exercise all
the acts of lordship3 would not have the power of
giving, selling, δῖα, his subjects, nor free use of their
possessions. Civil lordship by means of kings would
never have been necessary in a state of innocence.
CH.XXVI1- Varieties in circumstances, natural gifts, and acquire-

CH. 1'111· in which original lordship stands to possession and use
and to the objects on which it can operate. After
enumerating the different ways in which a man may
possess, he shows possession to be not a right but a
