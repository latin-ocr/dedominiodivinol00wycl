xviii PREFACE.

It has therefore seemed needless to make a regular
collation of the manuscript, or to record the results of
so much collation as Ι actually made. In two or
three cases I have taken a reading from it23 but as a
rule I have used it only to substantiate my extension
of the extremely contracted forms of words which are
characteristic of Β, and for this purpose it has proved
very serviceable in difficult or doubtful places.

In preparing the text of the present work for
publication, I have followed the same general rules
as in my edition of the De cz'vz'lz' Dominio, to the
preface of which (especially pp. xvi-xviii) Ι may be

‘ denotaciones’ may be worth mentioning. See too p. 217, n. 5. But
such specimens of readings supplied by D which are found in none
of the other manuscripts are quite exceptional.
