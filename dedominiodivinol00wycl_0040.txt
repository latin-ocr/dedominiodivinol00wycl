a discussion going on in London super mendicitate

warrant in Scripture or primitive tradition. The friars
were hotly excited by the archbishop’s action, and
succeeded in procuring his citation to appear and

defend his opinions before the pope at Avignon. *On

mon before Innocent VI, which has been frequently
published under the title of Defensio Curatornm.
FitzRalph's case was at once entrusted by the pope to
four cardinals for examination 3, but unfortunately no
record of the result is known to exist. It seems most
likely that, in view of the weighty interests engaged

and that FitzRalph died, probably in November, 1360,
before judgement was given. In the end the friars
