X PREFACE.

the De Dominio divino stood second and the De
Ecclesia last in the volume ¹. That the scribe was a
Bohemian is shown by the fact that not a few marginal
notes are written in Czech. These notes further in-
form us that he wrote in England, that the correctors
were likewise Bohemians‚ and that their work was
completed in 1407, or perhaps more probably 1408.
At the end of the treatise de Veritate sacrae Scripturae
is the note ‘ Correctus graviter A. D. 1407 in vigilia
Purificacionis sancte Marie Oxonie per Nicolaum
Faulfiss et Georgium de Knyehnicz ’ (f. 119 D). Now
Faulfisch is the man whom Aeneas Sylvius credited
with being the first to introduce Wycliffite books into
Bohemia23 and although the statement is so far in-
correct that other Bohemians before him had brought
home works by Wycliffe with them, yet its substantial
accuracy in mentioning the works De [me divino and
De Ecclesia among the books which Faulfisch took into
Bohemia may induce us to attach more weight than
is usually done to the list Aeneas gives of the works
carried home by him3.

Other Czech notes scattered through the volume
enable us to trace a little more of the scribe’s history.
Of the De Dominio divino the tenth chapter of book i.
was finished on Maundy Thursday4, the eleventh on
Easter Eve ⁵. At the end of the fifth chapter of
book iii. there is a note, Braybrilg psa720⁶‚ written at
Braybrook, which indicates that the scribe was working
