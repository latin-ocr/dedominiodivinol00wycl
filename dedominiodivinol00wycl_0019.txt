PREFACE. XV

letters and contractions‚ is—as indeed might have
been expected from the special experience and
learning of the collator—as near absolute accuracy
as any human performance can be. With A, unfor-
tunately, the case was very different. The copyist
who undertook the work was entirely without palaeo-
graphical training, and did not even take the pains to
inform himself of the meaning of familiar contractioris.
Although a classical student, he blundered on from
sentence to sentence without a thought whether the
words yielded any sense at all; and to add the last
straw to the editor's and the printer's burthen he

of letters were separated by a space, whereas separate
letters and words were run into one another; letters
liable to confusion were so written as to be most easily
confounded3 and the spelling,while professing to be that
of the original, was frequently but silently normalised.

In reading through the transcript I marked all the
places which seemed to me wrong, and noted all those
in which A differed from B to be collated with C.
These points were verified by Dr Rudolf Beer partly
under my direction and with my help in September,
1884, and partly by himself3 but so soon as I came to
printing, I found that the thorough untrustworthiness
of the transcript made it necessary not merely to test
it but to collate it afresh throughout. Accordingly in
January, 1889, I began a regular collation of A with
the printed sheets, a work which Dr Beer continued
and finished for me. Meanwhile I devoted myself to
the task of settling the various readings of Β and C,
of course with constant reference to the text of A.
Further doubts which arose in the course of the proof-
