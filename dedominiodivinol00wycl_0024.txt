XX PREFACE.

De Dominio ¹. On the other hand, the language in the
prologue is hardly precise enough to fix a title, while
two of the other catalogues speak of the work as
De Dominio divino. Stin, that there was evidently a
doubt on the subject is proved by the headings in
the manuscripts, Before book i. A and C have De
Dominio divim, but over the last word the corrector
of C has added absoluto: Β and D have simply De
Dominio, while the latter manuscript has in the table
of contents written within the cover De Dominio in
generali. Further‚ though the second book is so
numbered in all the manuscripts, the word secundus
has in C the number primns written above it, and the
table of contents in D gives this book the specific
title of De Dominio divino. Lastly‚ book iii„ as has
been noticed 2, bears no title at all in Codex D.

Division Wycliffe himself, at least when he wrote the De

mto books. civili Dominio, treated the work as a single book. To
show this I give the citations as there made, with the
places to which they refer :—

It may be conjectured that the treatise was divided
into three books for the sake of convenience, whether
by Wycliffe himself or a disciple may be left doubtful.
Perhaps on the whole it is most likely that Wycliffe
