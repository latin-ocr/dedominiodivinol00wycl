PREFACE. xxiii

Bohemia ¹. The externa] evidence, so far as it goes 2,
is unanimous; and every argument from the style
and method of exposition employed in the work
points in the same direction. As for the date at
which Wycliffe wrote the treatise, the internal evi-
dence is slender. From the terms of the prologue
it might seem as though this were Wycliffe's earliest
theological production3 but the reference made in it
to the De lucarnatz'one Verbi shows that the latter
work was at any rate completed before the De Do-
minio divino 3. The position it occupies as the in-
troduction to the Summa 2⁸72 Theologyo, and the refer-
ences to it in the several books of the Summa,
furnish us with a terminus ad quemn but unfor-
tunately the dates of these books have not yet been
fixed with any precision. The utmost that can be
said with certainty respecting the De civili Dominio
is that it was written previously to 1377, while
Shirley's date, 1372, is probably not very far from
the truth 4. How much earlier the De Dominio divino
was composed can at present only be conjectured ;

¹ See above, p. x. 1ts title does not occur in the list of books
condemned at Prague in 14103 Docum. Mag. Ioh. Hus, p. 380, ed.
F. Palacky, Prague 1869.

2 Ι have not noticed any allusion to the work in Woodford's polemio
against Wycliffe, printed in Orthuinus Gratius' Fasciculus Rerum ex-
petendarum et fugiendarum, pp. 190—265‚ ed. E. Brown, 1690 folio ; nor
in T. Walden's Doctrinale Fidei, for the citation made in the latter work,
lib. ii. art. iii, 82, p. 402 b, Venice 1571 folio, as from the De Dom.
div.‚ cap. ii„ is really taken from the De civ. Dom. i. 2, p. 11.

³ Where Wycliffe refers to the De civili Dominio (or, as he here
styles it, De humano Dominio), it is rather by way of a general
allusion to a future work which he had in contemplation. In book iii. 4,
p. 224 the particular reference is only apparent; for ‘libro ‘tercio'
denotes merely the third book of the Summa. On the other hand, in
book iii. 6, p.·255‚ we have a reference (though apparently a wrong
one) to a specified chapter, which may be a later insertion.
