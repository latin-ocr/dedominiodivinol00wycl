xlvi PREFACE.

every man his due conformably to the law of God.
It is a long discussion, and the primary contradiction
between F itzRalph’s theory and the existing condi-
tions of human society and law does not seem to be

brought nearer a reconciliation.
The book concludes with a discussion on property
and the right of use in connexion with civil lordship.
CH. xvn. Property in a thing in its direct sense is nothing else
than the civil lordship of that thing, but all civil lord-
ship is not property. For instance, the king or a
higher lord may demand support for a war from an
inferior lord, but they have no power to enjoy his
revenues. They are but lords mediate of the baron's
lordship, whereas he is lord immediate; and the lord
immediate is he who has property in that which is
Cn.xvn1-subjected to his lordship. Use, on the other hand,
XXI‘ may be exercised without any civil, indeed without
any natural, lordship. The servant may exercise acts
of lordship in his master's goods ; one may use things
CH. xxn. in which he has but a limited interest: one may re-
ceive a gift offered him and at the same time decline
to receive any civil lordship in it 3 his refusal will not
prevent his right of freely using the gift. All these
rights of use, however, proceed in some measure from
lordship, though it is not necessarily the user's lord-
ship. The subject of use leads naturally to the treat-
ment of the questions which more immediately concern
the controversy touching the manner in which the
mendicant orders could enjoy, if they could not hold,
property ; and to this point the three following books
are more particularly addressed. I have not printed
them because their bearing upon Wycliffe's views is
less direct; but the table of their contents will be

found below, pp. 264-272.
