title, the outward sign of lordship. All possession in CH. xv-
the proper sense of the word is righteous. To man vm·
was given at his creation both lordship and possession

of the whole world and of every part of it ; but he has

them in varying degrees according as he has a freer

or less free use of the things subjected to him. The Crux-xv,
question whether property could have corne into
existence without sin, is argued at length and finally
deeided in the negative. The conditions of natural CH. xw,
possession follow upon those of natural lordship, and XVH'
that which has been asserted of the latter, that it is
universal and is lost only through sin, is equally true

of the former. Lordship further involves use, which CH· XIX-
is its end and fruit, nobler and more desirable than it 3XXH'
but use is to be understood only of the reasonable
employment of things, any excess being not use but
abuse. The various acts in which original lordship CH.xx111-
may be exercised are next reviewed ; and here, as in xxxm.
book i. the chief interest centres in the act of giving.

This, it is explained, does not imply the transfer-

ence of the entire right to possess the thing given.

As in God's giving, so in the state of innocence, to

give is to share possession; it is also the rule of the
apostles and the rule of charity that all things should

be had in common. By sharing the gift both giver

and receiver derive most benefit from it ¹. Even

when, as under civil laws, a lord grants away one of

his lordships, he retains his natural lordship in that

which he grants. Indeed‚ a grant of this sort is not

really an act of lordship at all; the transfer is purely
accidental‚ dependent on the will of the receiver3
whereas lordship is by its very nature independent of

will 2. Is then all civil lordship vain? Not altogether,
