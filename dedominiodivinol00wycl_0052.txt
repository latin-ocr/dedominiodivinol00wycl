xlviii PREFACE.

Ralph, on the other hand, has a fully matured scheme
to propound. With a remarkably clear arrangement
and with few digressions he deals with lordship, pos-
session, and use as they concern God and man in his
state of innocence and then in his state of sin. His
treatment is as lucid as the nature of the subject
allows; his contradictions lie in the nature of the
subject as conceived by him. With Wycliffe’s De
civili Dominio the work of FitzRalph presents more
direct points of agreement 3 and I have no doubt that,
when the former's treatise De Stalu Innocentiae is
printed, it will be found that the same close connexion
exists with regard to it. The already published works
of Wycliffe gives us a sufficient proof of his indebted-
ness to FitzRalph‚ and what may be published here-
after can only add volume to the evidence for a fact
which I think may be stated as definitely established,
namely, that he has added no essential element to the
doctrine which he read in the work of his predecessor.
All he has done—this is in the De civili Dominio—is
to carry the inferences logically deducible from that
doctrine very much further than the purpose of Fitz-
Ralph’s treatise required him to pursue them, and very
much further than, from all that is known of Fitz-
Ralph’s character, it is in the least degree likely that
he would have pursued them.

It remains to add that in the footnotes of the present
volume citations from the fathers are made, unless
otherwise stated, from the editions published at Paris
by the Benedictines of Saint Maur. References to
Migne indicate the Latin series of his Cursus completus
Patrum. Aristotle is quoted by pages from the edition
of the royal academy of Berlin ; sometimes a reference
