PREFACE. XXV

things with which it might plausibly be identified. It
is not, he says, synonymous with right, since a man
may have a right to a thing without obtaining lord-
ship of it; but it includes right as the basis upon
which the relation proceeds. So again lordship is
not power. ‘No catholic will deny that the power of
the keys is committed to the priest‚ albeit he have
none subjected to his power.' Power therefore may
exist without lordship3 it may be granted to a man
and take effect when lordship is superadded3 but
it is always implied in lordship. A further question
arises, how lordship came into existence3 for that
it is not eternal is clear from the fact of its postu-
lating objects to act upon. The answer, that lord-
ship originated with creation, is supported by the
language of the Book of Genesis, in which the work
of creation is attributed to God, ancl it is not until
the lzeavem and tlze earth were finished that the
name Lord is used3 it was not until there were
creatures to serve God that he became Lord. God’s
lordship therefore is the immediate result of creation ;
and he is lord of his creatures because he created
them, not because he governs and keeps them. As
FitzRalph explains 1, ‘God has lordship by reason
of his creation of things, possession by reason of
his preservation of them, and use by reason of his
governance of them.’

Lordship may be divided according to its subject, CH. 111.
its foundation or principle, and its object. In the
first classification we distinguish the lordship of God,
of angels 2, and of men; in the second, specially in

in the strict sense of the word, lib. i. 9, 10, pp. ²9² seqq.
