xii PREFACE.

chapter is dated in Latin on the vigil of Whitsunday¹.
Further on, at the end of f. 163 2, the scribe com-
memorates in a Czech couplet the imprisonment of
two English Lollard priests, possibly the cases of
William Sawtree and John Purvey in 14013 for there
is no need to assume that the verses relate to an
absolutely contemporaneous event.

When we observe that the dates given follow one
another continuously,—Candlemas‚ Maundy Thurs-
day, Easter Eve, Whitsun Eve‚—it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that the work of transcribing and of
‘ correction’ went on side by side, and that all these
dates belong to the same year. In other words, our
scribe and his friends (or friend, for there is no reason
why the scribe himself should not be either Faulfisch
or Knyehnicz) finished the De Verz‘tate at Oxford on
the 1st February, 1407, went to Braybrook apparently
some time after Easter, and then removed to Kemerton
shortly before Whitsunday. If, as is on the whole
most likely, our Bohemian visitors adopted the Eng-
lish reckoning of time, the first date, February Ι, will
fall in 1407—8, Maundy Thursday on April 12, Easter
Eve on April 14, and Whitsun Eve on June 2, all in
1408. But the possibility, of course, remains that they
adopted the practice of beginning the year at Christ-
mas, in which case the dates would all belong to 1407
and the times fixed by Easter would be nineteen days
earlier.
