at a village in Northamptonshire, the rector of which,
Robert Hoke, was reputed in 1405 to be a heretic, and
was tried and made his recantation in 14251. The
manor-house belonged to the Latimers, and its late
owner, sir Thomas Latimer‚ who died in September,
1401, was a well-known Lollard leader 2. Braybrook
too was on the borders of Leicestershire, which
was in a sense the headquarters of Lollardy. It is
Henry Knighton‚ canon of Leicester, who says,
speaking of the latter years of the fourteenth cen-

duos videres in via quin alter eorum discipulus Wyc-
lyffe fuerit33' and he gives several specimens of
Lollard activity in the neighbourhood of Leicester
which have become commonplaces of Wycliffite
history.

Evesham, the home of the Lollard tailor, John Badby ⁵,
who was burned in 1410, and between the towns of
Tewkesbury and Pershore‚ which furnished armed
support to sir John Oldcastle when he was at Malvern
preparing for revolt a few years latere. The fourth
