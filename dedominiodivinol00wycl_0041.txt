PREFACE. xxxvii

stances of FitzRalph's biography only so far as they

bear on the date and composition of the De Pauperie

salvatoris. We have seen that it was begun in 1350,

and its dedication to Innocent the Sixth shows that it

was finished not earlier than 13531, but how much

later is not quite certain. Ι was formerly of opinion

that FitzRalph completed his work during the time of

his last sojourn at Avignon between 1357 and 1360 2;

but a more careful study of the language of his dedi-

cation has convinced me that it was written before he

left Ireland in [356. Like Ockham, he chose the form

of a dialogue for his work, a form which lends itself

more conveniently than a direct discourse to the raising

of obj ections and the -narrowing down of points at issue.
After a dedication recounting the circumstances in Subject of

which the work Was composed, FitzRalph states the &gfff

problem of which he seeks a solution: The religious CH. ι.

orders all profess to follow the life and teaching of

Christ and his apostles‚ and yet their rules differ and

have received different interpretations from different

popes ; the divergence mainly proceeds from the sense

they attach to certain terms, ‘lordship,' ‘property,’

‘possession‚' and the ‘right of using,' and the voluntary

surrender of these rights; it is desirable, therefore, to

examine minutely the true meanings and senses of

these words. Lordship is first distinguished from CH· ¹1-

property, which it does not necessarily involve, the

right of using, which it includes but which does not

necessarily include it, and possession, which is the

immediate result of lordship. Lordship is not eterna13 CH. 111, xv.

world, and antecedent to his government and main· CH. v.
