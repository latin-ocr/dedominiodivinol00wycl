xlii PREFACE.

since, in the present state of sin, it serves as a protectior!
against the attacks of evil doers : but when it is main-
tained that no one can reallyhave a thing unless he have
it by way of property, this is simply an abuse resulting
from the cupidity and self-seeking of wicked men.
The difficulty of adj usting the two titles to posses-

we might all freely enjoy another man's land but for
the possibility of his having a civil title to it, and this
title implies property. But this civil condition is no
