PRELIMINARY NOTICE.

THE following pages contain a description, first of the
Bodleian manuscript (Β), secondly of the Merton College
manuscript (M), and thirdly the table of contents of the last
books of Archbishop FitzRalph’s treatise, which are not here
printed. The text of the work is edited from the Bodleian
manuscript, and in all cases where the reading of M has been
adopted that of B is given in the margin. In a few instances
the reading of M is noticed in the margin, but no attempt
has been made t'o register the results of a full collation.

The Bodleian manuscript, Auct. F. infra 1. 2 (formerly NE.
Α. 6. 5 and numbered 1926 in the ‘Catalogus Librorum MSS.
Angliae et Hiberniae,' 1697), is a large folio volume written
on parchment, and consists of 401 leaves divided into double
columns with a fly-leaf prefixed. It is the work of several
scribes, and the date is of the latter part of the fourteenth
century. The second leaf begins, sepius excrescentes. The
initial letters are illuminated in blue with red scroll work of
a plain character. The book still preserves what is apparently
its original binding of rough white sheepskin3 but it will be
seen from the sequel that it consists of several collections which
were not at first united in a single volume. Within the binding
there is the note, ‘Collectarium ex dono domini Thome Erle
abbatis’ in a fifteenth century hand; to which is added in
different ink, ‘ claustralibus Rading.' Thomas Erle was made

abbat of Reading in 1409 and died before 12 January 1430 ¹.
On the fly-leaf prefixed to f. 1 the following table of con-

tents is written in a large Gothic hand :—

¹ Dugdale, Monasticon Anglieanum, iv. 32 b, ed. 1823.
