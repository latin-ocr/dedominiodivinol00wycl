xvi PREFACE.

reading Ι submitted to Dr Beer, who verified them,
wherever needful, in all the three manuscripts.

The present edition is thus made on the foundation
ofA: a complete collation of Β, omitting only ortho-
graphical variants ¹, is added 23 and C has been collated
wherever A and Β differ, as well as in a number of
cases where the reading both of A and Β presented
difficulties, but not regularly in the same way as Β has
been collated. I have often regretted that the tran-
script was not at the outset made from B, on account
of the peculiar interest attaching to that manuscript
and of the fact that it was written in England. On
the other hand, A has the appearance of being the
earlier manuscript, and it has the further claim upon
the Wycliffe editor of forming, like the unique
copy of the De civili Dominia one of a series of
manuscripts of the English divine written in the same
size ancl style and comprehending a large proportion
of his most considerable works. Moreover, while A is
written with the punctilious regularity and precision
of a standard book-as a work of one of the fathers
would be reproduced,—B is written with an indepen-
dence which had no scruple to correct mistakes.
Many of these corrections are indeed plainly right,
and not a few have been received into the text of the
present edition; but many also give evidence of the
scribe’s having altered sentences to agree with what
he thought was the meaning of the passage, when the
passage rightly understood needed no change at all.

¹ It should be stated that where Α has ‘ergo' B uniformly reads
‘ igitur.' This variant has been only noticed‚ once for all, in the critical
note to p. 5, l. 15.

² The beginning of each solio and column of this manuscript is entered
in the critical notes with the sign Η prefixed.
