failing such condition the law authorises nothing, and
thus it authorises nothing except per accidens. A
sinner may have a right or title to the civil acquisition
of a thing, but in no case to lordship, which is depen-
dent upon grace. In the course of the argument it
appears that F itzRalph uses the words ‘civil posses-
sion‚' as it has been seen he uses ‘ civil lordship‚' in two
different senses ε in the one it is definitely righteous,
in the other it is, as the case may be, either righteous
or unrighteous‚ human laws not going behind the fact
that a man is in possession.

In conformity with the arrangement observed in
books i. and ii.-iii. FitzRalph proceeds to discuss the
acts of civil lordship3 but not in the same regular
order, because it at once appears that giving cannot
without qualification be attributed as an act to civil
lordship. When a man hands over a thing to another,
this is not really an act of lordship at all, unless per
accidens, since the receiver may not choose to take
the civil lordship of the thing given: the only way in
which giving can be an act of civil lordship is by com-
munication. To this doctrine several objections are
urged. Supposing that the law requires the actual
conveyance of the thing given, may not the giver on
our showing declare that the transactionis complete
by the ‘ communication of civil lordship ' and withhold
the thing itself? Will not the law say that gift is
incomplete‚ and that the giver is still the lord of the
thing given? Nothing, it is answered, can excuse a
man’s retaining that of which he is not lord, and the
man in question is not lord of that which he has
given. If the law, looking only at the fact of posses-
sion, adjudge the thing to him who is not lord, re-
course must be had to a higher law. Are then the
