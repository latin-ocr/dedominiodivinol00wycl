is added to the volume and the folio of the Latin
version contained in the edition of Aristotle with the
commentaries of Averroes published at Venice 1550-
1552. The italic letters a and b denote the two columns
osa page, and the small capital letters added to citations
of pages mark the place in the page ; but the letters
A, B, and C, D, when referring to manuscripts or books
not paginated, indicate respectively the two columns
of the recto and verso of a folio. I am indebted to
Mr F. D. Matthew and the Rev, H. Rashdall for a
number of suggestions and corrections in my edition,
to Dr Rudolf Beer and Mr George Parker for help
in the collation of the manuscripts at Vienna and in
the Bodleian Library, and to Mr Furnivall sor the
kindness with which he has borne with me during the
long delay attending the completion of this book.
Nor must I omit to record my obligations to Dr
Goldlin von Tiefenau, and Herr Ferdinand Mencik, of
the imperial library of Vienna, for their courtesy
during my visits to that library‚ and to the warden
and fellows of Merton College for the loan of their
manuscript of FitzRalph’s treatise which they gener-

ously permitted.
