GLOSSARY TO WYCLIFFE'S TREATISE
DE DOMINIO DIVINO.

WORDS or significations not found in Dueange's Lexicon mediae et infimae
Latinitatis (ecl. 1885—1887) are distinguished by an asterisk prefixed. In the
case of words which though rare have still classieal or sub-classical authority,
such authority, taken from Lewis and Short's Dictionary, is added within

square brackets.

This glossary does not include words which form part of

the accepted scholastic terminology. The large and small numerals refer to

the pages and lines of the edition.

sense (gf the word, and so used
as equiV. to κατ’ ἐξοχήν, 185 ¹⁶,

nomine! The spelling alternates
with ‘ antonomatice’ which in-

 

dicates possibly the original
and correct form of the word
(cf. Mr E. C. Thomas's note to
Rich. de Bury, Philobiblon,p.2 5,
1888); but the figure of speech
known aS ἀντονομασῖα 15 not
appropriate to the later usage
of the word, which seems to re-
quire a derivation from αὐτός and
is regularly written with a u in
Wycliffe. Cf. ‘Aristoteles . . . an-
tonomatice, id est excellenter,
philosophus appellatur,’ Ioh.
Saresb„ Metalog. ii. 16 ; ‘Anto-
nomasice Paulum solemus vo-
