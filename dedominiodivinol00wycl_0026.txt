plete copies being in existence. It is true that one of
these, the third, speaks of book i. as containing 29
chapters instead of 193 but it gives the number of
chapters in books ii. and iii. exactly as we now possess
them, and for a reason that will immediately be ad-
duced we may take it that 29 is a mistake of the
copyist for 19, the figures 1 and 2 being frequently
confounded in transcription. The only evidence for
the number of chapters of which any of the books
originally consisted is that supplied in the reference
given above from the De civili Dominio to chapter
xxiii. Since this reference is apparently to be verified
in book ii. 3, it results that book i. in its complete
form contained twenty Chapters ; so that less than
two are missing from our existing copies. The
original length of books ii. and iii. must at present be
left unsettled3 but it is far from improbable that
some indication may be discovered in one of the
books of the Summa which await publication.

Authorship That the treatise de Dominio divino is by Wycliffe

secondly, by its inclusion in three out of the four
existing catalogues of Wycliffe's works ¹,—its absence
from the fourth need raise no difficulty since this list
is in many ways defective 3—thirdly‚ by the reference
it contains2 to Wycliffe's book de Incarnatione Verbi}
fourthly, by the references to it in Wycliffe's De civili
Dominio 3, the genuineness of which has early testi-
mony in the quotations from it in pope Gregory the
Eleventh's bulls of 1377 3 fifthly, by the mention of
it (in the form De Iure divino) by Aeneas Sylvius
