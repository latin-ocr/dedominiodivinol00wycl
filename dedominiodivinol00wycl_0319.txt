PRELIMINARY NOTICE.

After f. 337 two leaves are left blank, and then on f. 340
>begins an entirely new semion, consisting of sermons ‘ de
natali Domini,' ‘ de visitacione,' ‘ similitudines de sancta
Maria‚’ sermons ‘ de sancta Maria,’ and on various occa-
sions, as far as the end of f. 401 D, where the collection, and
with it the volume as we now possess it, ends defectively.

The Merton College manuscript 113 (formerly o. 2. 7.
Art.‚ and earlier still D. 5. 12) is a folio volume, written in
double columns on parchment. On the first fly-leaf is
written (reversed) ‘Iste liber legatur collegio de Mertonhalle
a magistro Iohanne Ryseborw quondam socio eiusdem
domus, cuius anime propicietur Deus. Amen.’ Rysborowe,
or Risborough‚ is said to have been fellow of Merton
College in 136012 in 1377-8 he accounted as ‘supervisor
operis' for the expense of building the college library ; and
his name appears as bursar at various dates down to 1397 ².
The book is in a rough calf binding of the seventeenth
century, and has on the inside cover a table of contents in
the handwriting of the former half of that century. According
to Coxe ³ it contains 233 leaves, but they are only occasionally
numbered. In the date he assigns to the volume ‘saec. xiv.
ineuntis' must be a misprint for ‘exeuntis,' since no part
of its contents can be safely placed many years before 1400.
The book contains :—

Holcot super sentencias : Utrum quilibet viator. The well-
known work of Robert Holcot‚ printed by John Trechsel at
Lyons 1497, 4to. (Magistri Roberti Holkot Super quatuor libros
sententiarum questiones). The manuscript contains, with
certain omissions, the commentary‚ until the point where it
ends, that is, as far as signature o v, col. 2, in the printed edi-
tion. Then follows a short narrative passage concerning Daniel,
after which the commentary is resumed‚ and the part dealing with
Sent. ii. qu. 4 and ii. qu. 3 is given. After these comes on a new
leaf (f. 107) a determinatio ‘ Utrum prescitus sicut et predestinatus
faciens fructus bonos eterne vite meritorios possit decedere fina-
