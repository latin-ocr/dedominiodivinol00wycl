cliffe’s vi'ew of creation admits the eternity of the
world. The answer, which includes an interesting
survey of various opinions on the subject, maintains
that the world began, in its entirety, at a given
instant of time, and that to suppose it to be an
eternal emanation from God would involve its abso-

free will and merit.

Here the first book might have ended3 but the
introduction of the question of necessity and free will
in the last chapter, as well as incidentally elsewhere,
makes it desirable to pursue the enquiry further3
especially since two of Wyeliffe's masters in theCH.x1V.

and Archbishop Bradwardffle, held discordant views
on the subject, the former laying the greater stress
upon free will, the latter upon necessity. Wycliffe
seeks to hold a middle course between them by the
help of the Aristotelian distinction between that which
is necessary absolutely and that which is necessary on
a given supposition. God necessitates man to perform
actions which are in themselves neither right nor

agency. He does not will sin, for he only wills
that which has being, whereas sin has no being3

the relation subsisting between God’s will and human
