position is vindicated by the argument that the men
have still ex hypothesi enough to live upon, and if they
wanted more this would be grasping, in other words,
not an act of lordship but an abuse of lordship3 and
as it is not supposed that men would admit a co-
partner beyond the resources of their land, the diffi-
culty which would thus arise is eluded 1. But the
community of the lordship is an essential element in
the argument, which would not hold good were it
a question of holding in severalty (proprietas); and

loses nothing by the act. He communicates to all
creatures himself and his lordship, albeit they are
capable of receiving it but incompletely2: he retains
not only his lordship over the thing given, but also his
possession and right of use of it 3.

conformably to reason.' The terms of this descrip- CH. 111-v.
tion are explained in detail, and it is inferred from the CH. V1-
fact that lordship was granted to man in a state ofVffl‘
innocence in the image and likeness of God, that
he was created in justifying grace, which was the
antecedent ground of his lordship. Lordship is
founded in grace, and without grace there is no lord-
