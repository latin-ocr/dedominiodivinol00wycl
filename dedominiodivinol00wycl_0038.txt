xxxiv PREFACE.

deserve de congruo, that is, ex condecente lege mag-
nzfica ac graciose z'ztvamz'ne Dominanm. Grace is
the antecedent condition of such deserving3 but the
fact that God's help is necessary does not take away
from the merit of him who runs his course aright.
The merit is of grace and the reward is of grace3
but none the less man would deserve nothing unless
by the exercise of his own power of volition. An
exposition of the doctrine of grace leads to a further
enquiry into the relative shares taken by God and
man in causing man's merit. It is shown that the
operation of God’s grace is the principal cause, and
that while no one can have merit ‘of works’ (ex
operibus) he can have merit ‘through works' (per
opera) of God's grace. The discussion of the subject,
in reply to objections, is carried on to the end of the
book as we now possess it.

As the De Dominio divino forms an introduction to
Wycliffe’s Summa, so the work of Richard Fitz-
Ralph, archbishop of Armagh, de Pauperz'e Salvatorz's,
of which the first four books are printed in the
appendix to the present volume, may be considered
in many ways as an introduction to Wycliffe’s doc-
trine of lordship as a whole. I give an account of
the manuscripts from which it is edited in a notice
prefixed to the text of the work13 here it will be
necessary only to explain the circumstances in which
the treatise was written, and to give a sketch of its
contents.

faithful transcript of the Bodleian manuscript, which was made for me,
under the superintendence of Mr George Parker, assistant in the
library, by his daughter, Miss A. F. Parker‚ to whose care and
knowledge Ι am greatly indebted.
