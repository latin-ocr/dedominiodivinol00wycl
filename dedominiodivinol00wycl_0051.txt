PREFACE. xlxiii}

It is no part of the plan of this preface to examine Wyejiffe‘s
minutely the relation subsisting between the doctrine ffilsstffssssss
of Wycliffe and that of his predecessor. The con-
nexion was indeed noticed very early. Woodford, in
his polemic against Wyclifse‚ discussing the latter's
position quod ad verum dominium seculare requiritur
iustitia dominantis, sic quod nullus in peccato mortali
est dominus alicuius rei ¹, quotes FitzRalph, de Paup.
Salv„ ii. 11, pp. 3 52 seq„ and other places, in support
of the condemned doctrine2‚ and controverts FitzRalph
and Wycliffe in a single argument. Walden also
seems to allude to the archbishop as a well-known
source of Wycliffe’s opinions 3. But the close con-
nexion subsisting between the two writers is too mani-
fest to need proof from outside. Only the first book,
however, of the De pauperie Salvatoris comes into
account with reference to the present treatise of Wy-
cliffe3 and of this latter it may be safely asserted, that
did we possess it entire, the points of connexion would
be much more striking than now when we miss (appa-
rently) a large part of the exposition of the acts of
God's lordship. The De Dominio divino is indeed
only in a small part devoted to the immediate subject
indicated by its title. Wycliffe seems, as it were, new
to the work, and is more anxious to attach his doctrine
of lordship—the importance of which probably he had
as yet but imperfectly realised—to a well-known and
accredited metaphysical groundwork than to develop
it independently. He hints at the solution of prob-
lems which he is not yet prepared to work out. Fitz-
