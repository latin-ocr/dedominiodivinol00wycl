Cod. 1294 (formerly known as Cod. theol. 388 ¹ and COD. B·
here denoted by the letter B) is a large octavo volume
written on parchment and bound in wooden boards,
the flyleaves consisting of a Moravian charter of the
year 1401. The book measures 245 >< 16 centimetreS.
The page is divided into two columns; and each
column measures 18 ><5·5 centimetres‚ the interval
between the two being about 5 millemetres. The
whole work, except the indexes, is written in one very
fine delicate hand, from which proceed also some of
the marginal catchwords and glosses, the remainder
being due to the correctors. The initial letters of the
chapters are not filled in, as they were intended to be,
in colour. The volume contains :—

1. The treatise de Verilale sacrae Scrz'pturae, f. 1; with
index in a later hand, f. 120.

2. The treatise de Ecclesia, f. 128,· with index in a later
hand, f. 208.

3. The three books de Dominio divino, f. 212, ending
defectively on f. 251 D.

The three sections bear an old separate pagination‚
and a comparison of the dates given in the margin of
the manuscript leads to the conclusion that originally

¹ Cod. theol. ccccv. in Denis’ catalogue, 1 (2) 1507—1510. Dr Loserth
takes this manuscript (which he calls A) as the basis of his edition of
the treatise De Ecclesia published in 1886. He gives a full description
of the volume in his introduction, pp. xvii.—xix.
