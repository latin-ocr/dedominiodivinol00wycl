viii PREFACE.

delicacy but also with some pretension to artistic
design. The date of the manuscript may be assigned
to the first years of the fifteenth century, and the
corrections altera manu are those of a contemporary
ὃιορθωτὴς who apparently did nothing more than
collate the text with its exemplar. There is no evi-
dence to show the country in which it was written.
Like the manuscript of the De cz'vz'lz' Dominio, though
in neither case is it possible to arrive at a certain
conclusion, it may well have been written by a
Bohemian scribe in England and then transported
into Bohemia. On the ground of its early date this
is perhap5‚ on the whole, most likely ¹. The volume
contains:—

1. The three books de Dominio divino, f. 1.

2. <Liber Mandatorum qui est primus in ordine Summe
sue et presupponit istos tres tractatus de Dominio
precedentes‚’ f. 91.

3. ‘Tractatus de Statu Innocencz'e‚’ f. 237, ending defectively
on f. 248.

Within the first cover of the binding is the following
note z·—

‘Iste est ordo librorum Summe sue in theologia:

Primus, liber Mandatorum‚ et presupponitur tres libros
de divino Dominio;

Secundus„ de Statu Innocencie ;

Tercius, quartus, et quintus, de Dominio civili;

Sextus, de Veritate sacre Scripture,’

and so on to the twelfth book de Blasphemia. Then
follows :-—

‘ Secundum aliam quotacionem iste est ordo:

¹ The regular spelling of evangelium and its derivations with a w
probably points in the same direction: so too the abbreviation of
Lz'ncolnz'ensz's as Lincotffn. (p. 246 l. 1), and of Ardmaclzanz', which is
osten written more like Ανιίίιιᾱῑ, a form which actually occurs, with the
z' dotted, in the margin off. 42 C.
