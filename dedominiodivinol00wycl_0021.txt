PREFACE. xvii

In other words, A is a mechanical transcript, while B is
the work of one who thought for himself.

That A and Β are independent copies, and not even Relation of
copies of the same archetype, may be taken as certain. &gazzim-
They have all the appearance of standing to one
another in the relation not of sisters but of cousins.
As for C, I have little doubt that it is a direct tran-
script of A 1. The number of cases in which it agrees
with B as against A is very small, and most of these
are of the nature of corrections of obvious errata.
Had I been persuaded of this at first, Ι should not
have carried out the collation of the manuscript even
as far as I have done; but since the collation was
done and in part printed before I had arrived
definitely at this conclusion, I thought it best to leave
it as it stood. Still, it must always be borne in mind,
in considering the evidence for any particular reading,
that, unless my judgement is quite wrong, C has no
claim to be regarded as an independent witness.
With respect to D, Dr Loserth’s proof that its text of
the De Ecclesia is ‘simply a copy of' B may be con-
fidently extended to that of the De Dominio divino,
which I collated in selected passages taken from
various parts of the book. The instances in which it
conforms with A or C, or both, as against Β, are very
few, and may for the most part be accounted for as

due to misreadings of contractioris or ambiguous

¹ The following example affords nearly convincing evidence of this.
In p. 97, ll. 20—24 a passage is omitted both in A and C. In the
former manuscript the omission occurs at the end ‘of a page, and may
easily be accounted for by the common mistake of homoeoteleuton as
the scribe turned over the leaf. In C on the other hand the error
cannot be explained in this way, since it does not occur at the end
of a page3 the presumption therefore is that the scribe was copying
from A.
