[f. 293 D.]

This collection, which is anonymous, has headlines here
and there indicating the contents :—

Sermo de mortuis. [f. 304 C.]
Sermo de martiribus. [f. 307 D.]
De confessoribus. [f. 313 Β.]

This last head—line is continued as far as f. 337 Β, on which
is a memorandum in the handwriting of the first half of the
fifteenth century: ⁶ Hee sunt themata contenta in parte pre-
cedente huius voluminis‚' with a list including everything now
comprised in the book from ff. 237 to 337, in other words
all the next preceding section of the volume excepting the
anonymous sermon Ad le levavi oculos (ff. 23 1—2 36). Thus
the portion written in the same or like handwriting, when it
was first gathered together, contained only ff. 237 to 3373
afterwards the great treatise of FitzRalph (ff. 1—84) and the
sermon Ad le levavi (ff. 231—236) must have been added;
and later still the two sections ff. 85—103 and ff. 104-230.

¹ Kilwyngton, or Kilmington, it may be noticed, had been associated
with FitzRalph in the learned company which formed the household of
Richard of Bury, bishop of Durham, and which included also Thomas
Bradwardine, Walter Burley, Robert Holcot‚ and others of less note.
See W. de Chambre, Cont. Hist. Dunelm.,in Hist. Dunelm. Scriptt. tres,
p. 1 28, 1839. Kilwyngton was made archdeacon of London in 1 350, and
a few years later dean of S. Paul’s (Le Neve, Fasti Eccl. Anglic. 2. 31 1,
321, ed. Hardy). He took partin the controversy against the mendi—
eants which gave occasion to the production of FitzRalph's work, and
seems to have written a treatise against FitzRalph’s F ranciscan opponent
Roger Conway (W. Rede, Vit. Pontiff„ ap. Tanner, Bibl. Brit.-Hib.,
p. 197); but no traces os it are known to exist.
