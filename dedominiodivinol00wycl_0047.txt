real part of lordship, it is merely accidental to it.
Before sin came into the world there was no property.
Property then is no clement in original lordship, nor CH. 11.
clearly is it the same with possession: it is a lord-
ship acquired by one or more persons in a civil state
of society, which excludes use in other53 but this ex-
clusion of use, though an invariable accompaniment of
civil possession 1, is nevertheless accidental. This
accidental character runs through all the current
notions of civil lordship. We speak of the eldest son CH.111‚1v.
as heir to his father's goods, one who will in course
become lord in his place, whereas in truth no man is
lord except through justifying grace. The argument
is complicated by a confusion of two distinct uses of
the phrase ‘civil lordship.³ Ideally it is that only
which is conditioned by grace3 practically‚ it is that
which is protected by civil law. The former condi-
tion, according to FitzRalph‚ is the essential fact in
civil lordship 3 the latter is merely accidental. Lord-
ship is granted by God on the condition of doing him
due service, and so soon as a man falls into mortal sin
he forfeits not only his original but his civil lordship.
All that the firstborn has in respect of his father's CH. v.
possessions is a title to the obtaining of them, suppos-
ing that he fulfil the other implied condition: his
primogeniture raises a presumption in his favour3 that
is all. It is naturally objected that the law seems to CH. v1.
point in a different direction: but F itzRalph replies
that no law or legal award confers lordship or right3
it only declares who may hold particular things with-
out molestation on the part of legal authority, The Cavn-
truth of the facts upon which a legal decision is given X'
is assumed as an antecedent condition to its validity ;
