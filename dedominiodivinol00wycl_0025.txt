PREFACE. xxi

did not himself make the arrangement, and that we
have in the uncertainty of the titles of the several
books an indication that the editors were not quite
sure of their ground. They found the first chapter
of book i. beginning ‘In tractando de dominio’3
and comparing this with the phrase ‘a dominio in-
choandum ' in the prologue> they headed the book De
Dominio. Book ii. begins ‘ Iam secundo restat lacius
disserere de dominio divino’3 and this furnished a
natural title about which there could be no doubt.
It ought of course to have followed that book iii.
should be numbered book ii. : but the parallel between
its opening words, ‘ Redeundo iam tercio ad materiam
que directius concernit dominium‚’ and the words in
book ii. just quoted, left the editors no choice but to
call it book iii. Afterwards as the work was repeatedly
read and transcribed it became clear that De Dominio
divino was the real title, as it was the real subject, of
the whole treatise3 and this conclusion we find adopted
in A as well as in two out of the three catalogues of
Wycliffe's works which mention the title 1.
All the three books of the De Dominio divino have Fragment-

come down to us in a defective state, and in all the ῗζζ Ξὲὲξῇοί
manuscripts they break off at the same point. Nor

do the old catalogues give any evidence of more com-

pp. lxxx. seqq), which is in other respects very incomplete. Shirley
suggested (Catal. of the orig. Works ofJ. Wyclif, p. 53, Oxford 1865) that
the work de Arte sophistica from which erroneous opinions were ex-
cerpted by a committee appointed by the University of Oxford in 1409
(see H. C. Maxwell Lyte, Hist. of the Univ. of Oxford, p. 283, n. 2,
1886> was really the same with the De Dominio divino ; but only one
of these articles, which will be found in Wilkins’ Concilia, iii. 346, bears
any close resemblance to the latter work, and it is likely that they come
from VVycliffe's philosophical treatises. Two of them, however, artt.
169, 170, refer manifestly to his latest doctrine.
