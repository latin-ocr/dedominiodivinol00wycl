PREFACE. xix

notes, the reference has been supplemented by the
number of the verse in the Vulgate. I have 3150 paid
no attention to the use of capital letters, punctuation,
and division into paragraphs found in the manuscripts.
With these exceptions the edition aims at a faithful
following of its original, with all its irregularities
and monstrosities of spelling13 but I cannot but fear
that this aim, in consequence of the exceedingly
bad transcript I had to work upon, has been not
quite perfectly carried out. Each new collation dis-
covered new and gratuitous blunders, and I am by
no means confident that I have succeeded in effacing
all the mischievous doing of my transcriber. I be-
lieve however that such errors as remain concern only
details of spelling, which are apt to elude even the
most vigilant collator, and do not affect the sense.

is shown not only by the first note written in the cover
of A2, but also by the first of the four early catalogues
of Wycliffe's works printed by Dr Buddensieg 3. It
has, however, been disputed whether its title, or at
least the title of its first book, should not be simply
De Dominio. Lechler inferred this, first, from the
terms of the prologue‚ ‘Consonum videtur a dominio
inchoandum‚’ and secondly‚ from the fact that the

third catalogue of Wycliffe’s works gives the title as

¹ Perhaps it should be mentioned that uu has been printed for w
where the latter stands for two letters, as in ‘ distingwntur,' ‘ wlt.'

² Supra, p. viii. The second note, ibid„ which makes it the first book
of the Summa, is contradicted by the numbers given in the manuscripts
to the actual books of the Summa.

³ Polemical Works, 1., intr„ p. lxvi. So too apparently in the second
catalogue, where the title is miswritten ‘ de dominio domino (?)‚’ ibid„
p. lxxii.
