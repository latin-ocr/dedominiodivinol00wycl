2 Future I‘ncome for Printz'ngy (md Editinq.

Salvatorz's 01 Richard Fitz-Ralph‚ Archbishop 01 Armagh—to
whose doctrine of Dominion, Wyelif owed much—will be issued;
28 sheets of it are printed off, the remaining 5} are in type. It
will be ready in October, and is estimated to cost ..3208 18. 11d.,
which (with the binding, etc.) must be paid out 01 the income
Of 1891.

For 1891, Dr. Beer’s edition of De Ente Predieamentalz' and
Quaestc'ones Loyoe'cae will be ready this year. The text is all 111
type, half the Introduction is 111 hand, and the rest is nearly ready.

For 1892, Prof. Loserth's edition 01 De Euchamm'a has the text
all 111 type, and the Indexes and Introduction will be ready soon,
so that the book of 21 sheets should be out by Christmas.

For 1893, Mr. Dziewicki's edition 01 De Blasphemm has 10 of its
18 3110013 111 type, and will probably be finished before the end
01 the year.

For 1894, Dr. Herzberg-Frankel’s edition of De Sz‘mom‘a, 8&
sheetS, has been long in type, and really ought to be completed
next year. By 1894 the Executive Committee confidently hope
that Members' support, and the help promist from America, will
enable them to resume the past issue of two volumes a year;
and 11 30, Mr. Dziewicki’s edition 01 Wyclif's Loyz'ea, 18 sheets,
will 110 doubt be the second book, as it can be ready 111 1891.

The matter is entirely in Members’ hands, They see the present
state 01 things, and the way out 01 it, and to the end 01 the
Society's work. Lz’beral and prompt payment of advanoe Subscrip-
tions is the one thz'ny now needed. And every Member 01 the
Society who cares for Wyclif should make such payment forthwith.

4. As to copying, M. Patera has completed De Potestate; Mr.
Austin has but another 6 weeks’ work at the long De Ente in the
big Trinity MS.; Mr. Dziewicki has nearly finished Loqz'oae Con-
rimatio—which turns out to be Wyclif’s most interesting Latin
work, inasmuch as he treats 01 many things in it, astronomy,
astrology, a little political economy, and so on‚—but the very
crabbed writing and the bad state of the latter part 01 the MS.
have given infinite trouble. These long treatises once done, only
a few shorter ones remain to be copied3 but some collation, and
foreign Editors will still have to be paid. The past years have——
by paying copiers—done much 01 the future years’ work, 30 that
the income 01 these years can be devoted to printing, binding, and
editing only, besides the usual incidental expences.

Members are askt to make a present sacrifice to ensure a
future benefit, the payment 01 the debt they owe to Wyclif's
memory. He must often have made like sacrifices in his 1110.
Η13 honourers should not shrink from them now.

The Society’s Oash Account for 1890 will be duly audited early
in the New Year, and sent to Members with the next Report.

5. The Subscription to the Society is One Guinea a year, pay-
able 011 every First 01 January. The payment of five or ten years'
Subscriptions 111 advance will greatly help the Society's work.
All Subscriptions and Donations,-which are much desired,—

should be paid to the Hon. Sec„ J. W. Standcrwick, Esq., Genera]
